      <span id="first" class="js"> JavaScript </span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] <span class="js"> JavaScript </span> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
      Alongside <span> HTML</span> and <span> CSS</span>, <span class="js"> JavaScript </span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] <span class="js"> JavaScript </span> enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js"> JavaScript </span> engine to execute it.
